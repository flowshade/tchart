# TChart Notes App
We have been working on something really cool - It’s a Notes App / T-chart generator! You can easily take notes and make T-charts!

You can take notes much easier, and it lets you be concise and 
minimal while maintaining legibility with your notes. Many students 
today struggle to take good notes, and have a hard time studying. 

### How it works
This note taking system consists of 2 parts - The main idea, and the details.

### How to Use
On the left, you can add your main ideas, with evidence on the right.
Clicking on the menu gives you two options: print or add. Clicking “add” makes a new Main Idea (or claim), and you can print (or save) your tchart, perfectly formatted. (To delete, ctrl+click on the item)

### Features
- Easily add short and concise notes
- Export to a fully formatted PDF or print with a click
- Clean UI
- Easy to navigate and use

### Coming Soon
- Light Mode
